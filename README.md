# California State Jobs Data Pipeline 

The primary objective of this project is to create a project pipeline to provide the information of the California state job. The dashboard is launched to capture the trends of public service employment and
income distribution of California. The pipeline needs proper deployment and monitoring with the inclusion of new data. With the help of SQL queries, we seek to discover the trends, similarities, disparities and pattern in the salaries of state jobs and median average income of different counties. The big counties such as Santa Clara, San Franciso, etc. have different median average income compared with the smaller counties as Yuba, Sutter, etc. The other objectives of this project is to find the disparities between the posted job salaries and average median salaries of the county. It would be interesting to find the highest paying careers and economic characteristics of the particular county. The trends captured form the county might not represent the state.
